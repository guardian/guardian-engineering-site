  <p>
    We value and respect all differences in all people (seen and unseen) at the
    Guardian. Here are some of the ways in which we help to promote a diverse
    and inclusive culture.
  </p>

  <h2>Recruitment</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Job advertisement and description screening</h3>
      <p>
        We use an augmented writing tool which uses a combination of natural
        language processing and data mining to screen our job postings for
        unconscious bias, reveal gendered language and help our job ads to
        appeal to a more diverse range of candidates.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Blind CV reviews</h3>
      <p>
        We redact candidate's names and educational institutions from CVs before
        they are reviewed by members of the Engineering team to avoid
        unconscious bias in the selection process.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>CV screening</h3>
      <p>
        Two members of the Engineering team independently review redacted CVs
        before meeting to discuss their decisions together. We encourage
        rotation of these groups to promote a broad and diverse range of
        reviewers.
      </p>

    ## Benefits

    ### Flexible Working

    flexible working can create a range of employment opportunities
    to suit both changing operational needs and the needs of
    individuals. It can also increase employment opportunities for
    anyone with caring responsibilities who are unable to work full
    time. We recognise the importance of flexible working as part of
    its wider commitment to diversity and equality in the workplace.

    ### Shared parental leave

    Shared parental leave is a period of leave of up to 50 weeks
    that can be shared between parents after their child is born up
    until the childâ€™s first birthday. It provides parents with more
    choice around how they balance their caregiving responsibilities
    and can help to improve diversity and inclusion in the
    workplace.
