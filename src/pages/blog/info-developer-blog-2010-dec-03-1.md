Here at the Guardian, we work on several things simultaneously – for example our [Open Platform](http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform) Content API, the new [Identity Platform](http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/identity-faq) and our [Discussion Platform](http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2010/oct/08/commenting-changes) which are detailed elsewhere. Some weeks we spend a lot of time on improving our R2 platform; other weeks we concentrate on other projects.

This iteration we've been working mainly on other internal projects, so this fortnight's release (number 102) is smaller than most. However, below are highlights of the changes we can talk about which we've added to our R2 core content management and delivery system:

We now include 'first published' in article history + newspaper meta data

Sometimes an article is updated so significantly that its publishing date is changed. We've now added the original publication date information to the article history so readers are able to see when the original version was published.
