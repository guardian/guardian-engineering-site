At the end of last year, Guardian Datablog and Datastore editor [Simon Rogers](http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simonrogers) and I appeared on a panel talking about linked data and the semantic web at the [news:rewired](http://www.newsrewired.com/) conference in London. The [BBC College of Journalism](http://www.youtube.com/user/bbccojovideo) recorded the day's sessions.

Here is Simon Rogers talking about some of the challenges the [Datablog](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog) has with the formats that data is released in, and demonstrating some of the interactive visualisations that the Guardian has made with data about the conflicts in [Iraq](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/datablog/interactive/2010/oct/23/wikileaks-iraq-deaths-map) and [Afghanistan](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/datablog/interactive/2010/jul/26/ied-afghanistan-war-logs) released by Wikileaks.

In my talk, I looked at how [we enable people to query our content using ISBNs and MusicBrianz IDs via the Open Platform API](http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2010/oct/18/linked-data-guardian-open-platform), and talked about some of the difficulties we have cross-referencing data, for example in [the COINS database](http://coins.guardian.co.uk/coins-explorer/search), when it isn't all linked and open. I also talked about how the URL structure of legislation.gov.uk might give some pointers to how news organisations could do timelines and versioning online in the future, and outlined how the widespread adoption of linked data might enable journalists to carry out sophisticated queries to get results that currently take hours and hours of painstaking research time.
