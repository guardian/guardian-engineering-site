Throughout May, the Guardian is opening its offices to developers as part of our commitment to the developer community. Each day from 4pm, you'll be able to turn up with your laptop and coffee, meet other developers, collaborate on projects or simply have somewhere to work for a few hours.

These drop-in events are free, but we will need you to sign up in advance. There will be limited spaces for those who suddenly find themselves available and would like to turn up on the day.

On some evenings throughout the month we will be hosting the odd talk â€“ if you would like to give one, let us know. There will also be a final shindig on 31 May, with surprise guests, beer and pizza for everyone who took part.

If you'd like to attend then fill in the form below.

For further information, contact Emma Mulqueeny or Adam McGreggor on 020 3353 2855 (please do _not_ leave voicemail) or first name dot last name @guardian.co.uk
