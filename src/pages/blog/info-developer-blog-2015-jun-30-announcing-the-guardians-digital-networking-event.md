The Guardian strives to be as open as we can be with our audience and our peers. Like many companies we are currently trying to hire great people to join us as we become a truly global and digital company.

As part of explaining what we are doing and how we are doing it, we often give talks at conferences and user groups. These are great avenues for opening conversations but we have wanted to do more and to be able to talk about things outside of the bounds of a particular interest group or technology. I am happy to announce our latest experiment: a [networking open evening](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/guardian-digital-development-networking-event-tickets-17336182990) here at the Guardian.

The evening will have members from all the different disciplines in development: engineering, product, QA, UX and data science. Our first event will not have a fixed agenda; we will have small talks that will set the context for the work we are doing. We want people to bring their own questions and comments to the Guardian team members and to use the [Open Space rules](http://www.openspaceworld.org/files/tmnfiles/2pageos.htm) to drive what we talk about.

We’re excited about trying this idea of having an open house and we hope you will be interested in both attending and giving us feedback about how we can be more open and how we can support networking and idea sharing across digital media.
