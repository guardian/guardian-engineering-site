We are pleased to announce that the Guardian Digital Fellowship 2018 is now [open for applications](https://workforus.theguardian.com/jobs/kin0001ct/).

The fellowship is an opportunity for software developers who are in the early stages of their careers to join our technology department. If you love coding and digital media then you can apply to the scheme irrespective of your background or experience.

Over 12 months you will develop your skills as an engineer, gain experience working on multiple teams and develop applications in the media industry. The scheme provides a structured path to becoming a software developer with support from experienced engineers and other fellows.

You will be building software hands-on as part of a team. We expect fellows to learn and grow throughout the scheme, and provide the space for them to do so. With the support of other developers, you will gain skills to become a fully fledged software engineer.

During the year you could be working on anything from shipping your code changes to the website or apps, adding functionality to the publishing tools used by our journalists or by analysing big data. Fellows rotate around different teams giving them a wide experience of different technologies and working environments.

In the digital department we work on a variety of projects with the common goal of supporting [the mission of the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/16/a-mission-for-journalism-in-a-time-of-crisis). We are very open about our [engineering culture](https://github.com/guardian/our-engineering-culture) and [recruitment process](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2015/jan/20/how-does-the-guardian-recruit-developers). You can learn more about the Guardian’s digital department and the work it does on our [developers’ site](https://developers.theguardian.com/) and [digital blog](https://www.theguardian.com/info/series/digital-blog).

To give you insight into the scheme from a fellow’s perspective, a few fellows from previous years have written a [post](https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/may/01/our-digital-fellows-share-their-experiences-of-the-scheme) on how their careers have progressed at the Guardian after promotion to a software engineering role. Also, Antonio Voce, a current fellow, has [written about his experiences so far](https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/may/02/the-digital-fellowship-is-your-foot-in-the-door-to-the-future-of-news).

We welcome applicants with diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. It is important to us that we hire the best people from the widest pool.

To apply for the position, we ask you to provide a CV along with written answers to our questions. You will then be invited to take part in a phone interview in late July, followed by an assessment day at the Guardian’s London office in August. This gives you the opportunity to informally meet people within the department and tour the office.

To get started with your application, follow this [link](https://workforus.theguardian.com/jobs/kin0001ct/). Closing date for applications: **30 June 2018.** Good luck!
