So. That was May. A month, where, for the first time, the Guardian opened its doors to external developers to come and join us for the afternoon, and sometimes in the mornings, to pick brains, write code, and have somewhere that's not a coffee-shop to work.

We were proud to be able to offer some insight into how a newspaper works, by inviting people to join us at the [editorial morning conferences](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2011/may/18/drop-ins-roundup), both to listen/observe, and [in](http://twitter.com/#!/nuxnix/status/76185085371621376) [three](http://twitter.com/#!/darkgreener/status/76288314386300929) [cases](http://twitter.com/#!/delineator/status/76230872877105152), to actually speak before the ensemble who attend — from all parts of the Guardian.

People came along to drop-ins for…

*   a quiet space to work with peers
*   a place from which to [launch](http://tribesports.com/) stuff
*   curiosity
*   the off-chance that a journalist will pop in
*   the talks

**But now…**

Editor-in-chief of the Guardian, [Alan Rusbridger](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alanrusbridger), announced, on 31 May, that the drop-ins will continue throughout June and July, on Tuesdays, from 2pm onwards.

A [Google calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/guardian.co.uk_aava7brs7c9ugjlpijb5rv5b74%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) is available for you to subscribe to.

In the same vein as the May drop-ins, we'll provide free Wi-Fi, tea, coffee, biscuits, soft drinks, and space to work/hack.

We are also inviting Guardian journalists and internal developers to join-in, which will be fun. We'll endeavour to run fortnightly talks, and update the calendar and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/gdndi) when we know more.

We're thrilled that this can continue. We hope to see lots more of you, and share some of the exciting changes in the Guardian as we move towards a more open and data-driven world of news.

We don't have a talk for you on the first of the June drop-ins, but, thanks to the generosity of [antibodyMX](http://www.antibodymx.net/) there will be some beers available after the drop-in.

Excited?

If you'd like to come along, please do sign up...
