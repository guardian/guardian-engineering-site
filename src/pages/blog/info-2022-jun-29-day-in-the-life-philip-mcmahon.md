Growing up playing video games in the countryside of Devon, Phil developed a keen interest in what he later realised was software development. From fixing laptops at university to spending eight years at the Guardian, he is a legacy member of the Product and Engineering department, and I hope you learn a little bit more about him.

**How did you begin your journey into software development?**

I spent a lot of time when I was younger desperately trying to get new video games ([Age of Empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires) was big at the time) to work on my too-old computer. I found I enjoyed the puzzle of working out what was wrong. When it came time for university I headed off to Bristol to do computer science. At uni I had a job fixing people’s laptops which I loved – it was free for people to use so they kept coming to us for help and always left happy!

**How did you end up working for the Guardian?**

I remember at uni someone from the Guardian had come to talk to us about the work they did on the [Edward Snowden story](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files), so I knew immediately it was an interesting place to work and when the graduate scheme came up, I jumped at the opportunity. I joined a cohort of 12 graduates from all different departments of the Guardian. It was fun as there were lots of people to go drinking with at the bar underneath the Guardian office, which was a lot cheaper back in those days.

**How has your career progressed in your eight years at the Guardian?**

I joined the [Content API team](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2016/feb/05/its-all-about-the-team) and stayed there for about six months. The Guardian was my first job, aside from fixing the laptops. I switched happy students for new colleagues and it was great. A big highlight in my early years at the Guardian was looking after the crossword system (a spiderweb of legacy bits of infrastructure), _finally_ I could explain my job to non software engineers. The great thing about the Guardian is that every time I felt a little bit less excited about what I was doing I was able to move teams. The variety is great because often you would join a team feeling a little bit under-qualified but leave it with a whole new area of expertise. After a particularly hot day in London took out the air conditioning in the Guardian’s datacentre, I became very involved in the cloud migration. After that I moved over to our website team where I stayed for a couple of years, and then was lucky enough to join the daily editions team (which produces our daily edition app). It was something I’d never thought possible as I had never done app development before.

  
**How did you find working remotely?**

During the pandemic I was working on the daily editions team and I can honestly say that working in that team during this time was one of the most joyful working experiences I’ve ever had. We had numerous deadlines but they were made achievable with such a close-knit team. Our daily stand ups were really a lifeline of human connection in quite a difficult time. Luckily, I was doing a lot of pairing at the time, whether it was training or just buddying up with other people for four hours on a call looking through code, which was a really important way for us all to connect from a distance.

**What project are you working on at the moment?**

The main thing we’re working on is improving the Guardian’s whistleblowing process. If someone has a story and they want to [contact the Guardian about it securely](https://www.theguardian.com/help/ng-interactive/2017/mar/17/contact-the-guardian-securely), we want to make sure they can do that as easily as possible. We also want to make sure the journalist at the other end doesn’t have to spend too long filtering through information. At the moment the process is quite arduous so we are trying to speed that up without compromising security. We also have to be ready for any big leaks or stories that could happen at anytime, these are the most exciting projects which can often involve dropping everything to work on the data and load it into our open source search tool called [Giant](https://github.com/guardian/giant/). Having worked here for so long I also tend to stick my nose in other projects and see where I can help.

**What is your** **favourite** **thing about working at the Guardian?**

I was involved in running our department’s ignite talks. These talks are an opportunity for anyone to share a story (no matter the topic) and it was really amazing the things people would come out with. I also know how important hiring is so I enjoy the interview training. Initially I was terrified to do an interview and now I’ve been doing it for seven years and I feel a lot more confident sharing my experiences. Overall, I think it’s really the people that have kept me here for so long, the work is interesting but the people are the soul of the place.

**What advice would you give your younger self?**

I think it would be best not to worry too much about career stuff at university. I feel like the university puts a lot of pressure on students to get summer jobs where they can get their foot into the industry. The nice thing about tech is there are quite a lot of jobs so you can probably spend your summers enjoying yourself.

_**Development of digital products is central to the Guardian. You could be building the products that showcase our progressive and independent journalism, crafting the tools that journalists use to write their stories, developing the services that allow those stories to be distributed across the globe, or safeguarding our financial future.**_
