The most common uses of the term _senior developer_ is to indicate either someone with a deep specialised knowledge beyond their peers or someone who leads or instructs other developers.

At the Guardian we have a general role of _software developer_ which we recently divided into five sub-groupings: associate software developer, software developer, senior developer, lead developer and principal developer.

Specific behaviours were attached to each role and the idea was to provide some kind of career progression in what is a very flat organisation. Initially the levels were intended to signal progression to people outside our own organisation and provide some career progression rather than having to explain how people could have spent seven years doing useful work without a change in job title.

In our description of the role a senior developer has an acknowledged area of expertise, mentors and coaches others on their team, understands the goals of the team, particularly in terms of outcomes or metrics, has an idea on how the team can deliver software more effectively, is a strong individual contributor and either talks publicly or is involved in the wider software community outside the organisation.

Whenever you create a structure it inevitably impacts on the way people think about their work. Although we are still very flat, we would generally like people who play the role of “technical lead” on a team to be a senior developer.

We have non-senior software developers who are tech leads though and the two things are not synonymous. For tricky projects, for example, it’s not uncommon to find many senior developers working together in either a loose self-organising group or in support of the designated technical lead.

In a recent tally we discovered that we had a ratio of about 1:1 senior to non-senior developers and that’s probably where we will try to keep it in future.

So after a lot of effort we felt we had defined what it meant to be a senior software developer, so everything is easy after that, right?

When recruiting though we need to explain what a senior developer is, not just to ourselves, but to people outside the organisation. Sometimes we also have the difficult job of explaining to people who currently have the title of “senior developer” why we don’t think they are a senior developer here at the Guardian.

It is worth saying that the developers at the Guardian are of a very high standard. Perhaps the highest of any development group I’ve worked with. So when we baselined the levels when they were created each one came out significantly higher than where the industry benchmark might be.

Many people who apply to the role of senior developer point to one or two key achievements in their career. They are an [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) expert, or have given talks at conferences, they may have coached other developers or made great coding contributions to open source projects.

All these things are great achievements, but for us being a senior developer is about demonstrating a broad range of experience with different roles, technologies and situations.

The only way to get that experience is to put in the time working in that area. Have you created an acceptance test suite? Have you been responsible for production systems? Has the team ever looked to you for leadership when all the alerts are red and the pagers are going crazy? If not then there are gaps in your understanding that cannot be filled by an online course or attending a conference.

We have made exceptions for people who excel in some areas but not others, but our goal for both internal and external people in the role is that they try to achieve the complete expectations of the role. If they cannot then we need to look at whether they are making a contribution to the group as a whole that outweighs the shortcomings.

A lot of people applying for a senior role at the Guardian are disappointed because they have a senior title in their current job and expect to retain it when they change jobs.

That does not make sense for us or them though. We only have five types of role and to keep them meaningful we have to be disciplined in not giving in to “title inflation”. To have and retain value the top roles have to have high standards.

Candidates might be disappointed to suffer a “demotion” when changing jobs but having a title is different from having the skills and abilities to excel in a job role. We strive to create great senior developers through training, opportunities to work on really hard problems, supporting an open development policy and offering a really talented peer group to inspire and collaborate with. The skills and experience people get on the way to becoming a senior developer matter far more than the title they had when they acquired them.
