Over the last few weeks we’ve been rebuilding and redesigning the navigation on our next generation website.

The user goals we identified were:

*   Giving you an easy way to get back to the homepage from any area of the site
*   Signposting where you are within the site structure
*   Providing paths to the top-level and sibling sections

While doing so, we also had to make sure it’s feasible, downloads in-an-instant and maintains a high level of visual identity and clarity for the Guardian site.

Who is the navigation for?
--------------------------

We have a massive range of different devices and browsers accessing the Guardian website. Mobiles and tablets can tip over 50% at times (and growing), but on average over the week we see a 60-40% desktop/mobile visit split.

There are also a mix of users who have differing familiarity with the Guardian brand. Those who are daily visitors are well aware of the diverse content we offer. However, a large proportion are on their first or second visit, particularly outside of the UK, and land directly on article pages.

For these users it is particularly important to show where they are in the structure of the site and the main areas of subjects we cover.

**Trade offs - Usability vs clean design**
------------------------------------------

A common challenge for mobile navigation design is trying to expose the breadth of content whilst preserving a clean design. This is not an easy challenge, and well documented with a great write-up from [Zeebox](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/04/08/ux-designers-side-drawer-navigation-costing-half-user-engagement/) and great examples from Facebook and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lukew/status/454637989503590400).

For visitors who are familiar with your content, a clean design is great and is quickly grasped and familiar to users after a few visits. Our mobile apps provide an elegant solution to this. With a much less familiar audience on the web, we knew we had to go down a different route. Even with the readers who are familiar with our sections, making it less clicks will not be unwelcome.

**Ideas**
---------

At the Guardian, in designing and developing our products we follow an agile process. Even within that process where focus is a principle, it’s all too easy to take on too large a variety of things.

In developing the navigation, we were determined to follow a process that was really focussed and collaborative. We had a small team including a mix of development, visual and UX design skills, and editorial.

Using the principles defined, our first step was to all come up with a number of ideas that would solve the challenges set out - focussing on mobile first.

Then, as a team, we evaluated the ideas against the criteria:

1.  Signposting
2.  Navigation to top-level sections
3.  Navigation to 2nd level sections
4.  Feasibility
5.  Visual clarity

We prioritised the ideas that scored highly across the board and from there, rather than choose 2 or 3 ideas, we focussed on what we thought was best. We could then optimise through trying different variations on smaller features from there on.

There was a concern we were trying to do too much in such a small screen space, but we took this forward and recognised we could easily reduce the scope if that turned out to be the case.

**Testing with users, early and often**
---------------------------------------

We know that as much as we can guess and assume what our readers want, there is nothing better than putting prototypes in front of them as early as possible.

From the Guardian website, we invited daily visitors to join a panel of users ([join here!](https://s.userzoom.com/m/MSBDMTBTMTU0)) to help us create the new website and provide feedback on ideas. Sending through [low-fi prototypes](http://stephanfowler.com/nav-hack/index4.html?section=culture&sub=music) to that panel of users was really valuable. These first prototypes had no content, but were very useful in getting that first impression and knowing we weren’t completely off the mark.

The next stage was to make it more realistic and let people try it out. We developed a prototype that would work with content and was completely realistic. Hallway testing throughout the office was enlightening and we followed this with a variety of end-users our research lab.

We spent two days watching, learning, tweaking and changing the navigation.

User testing gave us some surprising results and took us down some other paths, but in the end we had much more confidence that regular and new users could navigate to both the most obvious, and the most hidden sections.

**Make it real!**
-----------------

With the feedback and confidence gained from the user testing, it was then a matter of making it production-ready. Again, we tweaked and optimised, had some more internal and external testing until we arrived at a solution that achieved what we were aiming for.

Having a few principles to achieve in such a small area is complex, but we believe we've found an elegant, responsive solution for all screen widths.

We have prioritised the signposting at smaller screen widths, but the side-scrolling allows you to access any sibling or top-level section.

If side-scrolling isn't your thing, the All Sections is a familiar 'safety-net', giving you access across the site, starting with the section you are in.

We have also tried to make it easier to navigate through the subsections, for example in Culture you are always shown the next section in the sequence. The links loop around almost like a carousel - making it easier to click through the sections.

What's next?
------------

This has just been live for a day, but stay tuned to see how the engagement on the navigation, and on the site as a whole, has changed because of this update.

We will continue to improve the header and footer of the page, making it easier to find the topics you want to find. Please do let us know how you find the navigation and whether it works for you.
