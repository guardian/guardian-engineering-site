On 28 May, the Guardian's Kings Place offices will be hosting the latest [Knight-Mozilla News Innovation](https://drumbeat.org/en-US/journalism/) design jam, inviting people to "Hack the future of journalism online".

The event runs from 10am until 5pm, and is looking for people to team up and build prototypes that help journalists take advantage of the open web and engage with citizens in new ways.

The day is themed around three challenges:

*   [Unlocking Video](https://www.drumbeat.org/en-US/challenges/unlocking-video/): Tell stories better with video online
*   [Beyond Comment Threads](https://www.drumbeat.org/en-US/challenges/beyond-comment-threads/): Re-invent commenting and discussion
*   [The Open Webs Killer App](https://www.drumbeat.org/en-US/challenges/open-webs-killer-app/): Create news web apps

You can [apply for tickets](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1661526671/efblike), which are free, online.

And don't forget that during May, [our developer drop-in programme](http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/may/10/drop-in-experience) continues.
