This is the second of two presentations on how we work digitally at the Guardian, from [Mike Bracken](http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/mikebracken), who leads the digital technology team here. [The first was a short, high-octane presentation](http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2010/oct/25/wpp-stream-innovation) about innovating. This is much more in-depth and shows how the Guardian has built its digital capability, primarily through the power of social media.

Mike gave this presentation a couple of weeks ago at the [Gartner 2010 Symposium](http://agendabuilder.gartner.com/agendabuildersuite/webpages/SymTimes.aspx) in Orlando, Florida. [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com) is a consultancy which helps technologists from large companies learn from each other. This is partly by bringing all those people together at events like the Symposium, and partly by researching relevant topics and publishing their findings.

That's the audience and the context. Here are the slides, best viewed in fullscreen if you want to read the notes as well...
