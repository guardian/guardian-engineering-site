For the third year in a row, we are opening the [application process](https://workforus.theguardian.com/jobs/kin0000xv/) for our digital Fellowship.

The Guardian Digital Fellowship is an opportunity for developers who are in the early stages of their careers to join the Digital department. If you love coding and digital media then you can apply to the Fellowship irrespective of your background or experience. The Fellowship is a 12 month scheme that offers you an opportunity to ramp up to working as a fully fledged developer in a structured manner, alongside a cohort of Fellows. As a Fellow you’ll be expected to jump in and work as part of a team while being provided with the support and learning to acquire the skills of a developer.

Last year we broadened our requirements for the role and made contact with organisations such as [Code First Girls](http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/) and [codebar](https://codebar.io/) to help us advertise the role in places we had not tried before. We had a lot of interest in the Fellowship and had applications from people with a variety of backgrounds. A shortlist of applicants were invited to the Guardian offices to take part in an assessment day which also gives candidates an opportunity to look around our offices and meet people in the department in an informal way. After an assessment day we were able to offer 3 roles on the Fellowship. We plan to run the same process this year.

We enjoy working on a variety of projects in the Digital team with the common goal of ensuring our journalism has a global reach and impact. The best way to find out about what we get to up to is to read the Developer blog. This month we’re writing about the things we’ve learnt over the year. We strive to be open about our [engineering culture](https://github.com/guardian/our-engineering-culture) and [recruitment process](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2015/jan/20/how-does-the-guardian-recruit-developers).

The 2016 Fellows have each made their way into technology through [different routes](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/developer-blog/2016/jun/24/coming-in-from-the-cold-routes-to-becoming-a-software-engineer) and have made a positive impact to the team from the start. In the new year they will be rotating teams to gain experience with different technologies and meet different people within the business.

Our 2015 intake were all successful in moving to the Developer role this year and have, in turn, been a great support network for our current Fellows.

If you are excited at contributing to the Guardian’s future then you should [apply](https://workforus.theguardian.com/jobs/kin0000xv/). You can read more about the Fellows experience [here](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2016/dec/07/the-digital-fellows-a-new-hope).
