Every three to six months the digital development department at the Guardian spend two days away from their desks experimenting with new ideas to improve the way we do things. Hacks from the past have included Ophan, [the analytics platform which has transformed the newsroom](https://medium.com/@GuardianComms/behind-the-scenes-ophan-how-the-guardian-democratised-data-36cde3967062#.n2vqiuwci), and our breaking news web alerts.

The days are an opportunity for people to work on anything they want, with a theme provided for inspiration. This month we are focusing on ‘[the web we want](https://webwewant.org/).’ This is a topic which the guardian has [covered significantly](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/the-web-we-want) over the past few weeks, and one which could benefit from some attention from our own brilliant digital team.

In the spirit of the theme, we have opened up the event to your ideas. If you are a member, you should have access to this article and the thread “below the line”. Do you like an idea? Click recommend! Do you have a suggestion for improving an idea? Reply! Do you have an idea you’d like to add? Join the discussion!
