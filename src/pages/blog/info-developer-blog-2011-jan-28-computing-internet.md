Here is a brief summary of the latest updates and fixes that made it into Release 105.

Web publication date
--------------------

A new enhancement to the publication date of content has arrived. The web publication date, which populates the URL field, now automatically picks up the date when a piece of content is first launched (not when first saved!). This now prevents content going live with the wrong date in the URL.

Competition T&Cs
----------------

Due to a legal requirement, it is now impossible for anyone to enter a competition without actively ticking to say that they have read and agreed to Terms and Conditions (T&C's), so be sure to read the small print.

Defect fixes
------------

*   The automated page "All today's media stories" was appearing in the RSS feed for Media Guardian with the description value "null"
*   Tags that are hidden were appearing in the combiner trailblock associated with series and blog tags
*   Content sharing metrics was not working
