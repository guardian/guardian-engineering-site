Simone has had a very interesting career journey, from foreign languages to coding languages, a maternity leave, a promotion and countless important projects. She details how hard work and diversity within her role has kept her at the Guardian for the last four years and shares some very insightful advice to her younger self.

**Did you always have an interest in software development from a young age?**

Not at all! At school and university I was particularly interested in music and foreign languages (I studied Spanish and Russian at uni), and then worked in publishing at a foreign rights agency for seven years. It wasn’t until I was in my late twenties that I first started taking some online coding courses, which quickly showed me that this was something I really enjoyed and wanted to pursue.

**How did you end up working for the Guardian?**

I quit my job in publishing in 2018 and did a three month coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. I’ve never worked that hard before or since – it was an incredibly intense period, during which I worked seven long days a week for 12 weeks without a break, but it enabled me to get my first software development job at the Guardian. The Digital Fellowship scheme opened for applications a few weeks before the end of the course so I applied and was lucky enough to finish Makers knowing I had a job lined up afterwards.

**How has your career progressed/changed in your time at the Guardian?**

I joined as a digital fellow nearly four years ago, and spent six months on the apps team, splitting my time between iOS and Android development, before moving to Ophan (the Guardian’s in-house, real-time traffic tool). Nearly three years, one maternity leave and one promotion later, I chose to move back to apps, and am now an iOS developer. One of the things I love most about working at the Guardian is the opportunity it provides to try new things. I don’t think there are many places where I would have been able to switch from backend to mobile development so easily. I think it’s hugely beneficial personally, but also for the company to have people moving around and sharing knowledge across different disciplines in this way.

**How did you find working remotely?**

I enjoyed it a lot more than I had expected to! I think it definitely helped that I was working in a small, close-knit team (Ophan) that paired on all the work we did, so I never had the chance to feel lonely or unsupported by my colleagues. In the early days of lockdown there were lots of remote social activities organised by other members of the department, which meant we still had the opportunity to socialise with people outside our team. Having said all that, I’m back in the office one day a week now, and am really enjoying bumping into people again in real life and feeling a part of the wider organisation.

**What does a typical day look like for you?**

Since coming back after maternity leave I’ve been working compressed hours, which means I have every other Friday off and start early each morning to compensate. The early mornings are generally a good time to focus on something, as not many other people have started working yet. Since moving to the iOS team, I’ve often been using that time to build my familiarity with Swift and iOS frameworks through online tutorials. At 10.30am we have an iOS and Android stand up for the wider team, including people from design, UX and QA teams among others. That’s followed by an iOS developer-only stand up, where we can go into the technical details of things we’re working on and help each other out. My calendar is generally fairly busy with regular team meetings such as dev time, demos, retros, and planning, but there are plenty of chances to focus on something and do some deep thinking as well.

**What project are you working on right now?**

I’ve recently done a lot of work on the user interface of the app, making incremental changes that give it a more modern feel and bring it more into line with how stories are displayed on the website. We have a lot of iOS developers working in different teams across the department so there’s a lot going on at once, but I’ve enjoyed working on a specific project and being able to see my changes with each release! We also have some work coming up on improving the accessibility of the app. The Digital Accessibility Centre – a non-profit company created to create digital media that meets best practice accessibility standards – are now doing an audit of the app. Following the audit we will soon be implementing their recommendations to ensure that our app is accessible to everyone.

**What advice would you give your younger self?**

I used to be afraid of asking ‘silly’ questions. When I changed careers, it became much easier for me to ask questions, because there was no expectation that I already knew the answer. I also realised that it enabled others to get the answer too without having to ask the question themselves. So I’d tell my younger self to start asking questions sooner, and to worry less about what other people thought! I also love everything written [here](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known), especially: _Take note if you find yourself wondering “Where is my good knife? Or, where is my good pen?” That means you have bad ones. Get rid of those._

_**Development of digital products is central to the Guardian. You could be building the products that showcase our progressive and independent journalism, crafting the tools that journalists use to write their stories, developing the services that allow those stories to be distributed across the globe, or safeguarding our financial future.**_
