The third week of the Guardian's Developer Drop-in is now reaching its climax. We've got a few more updates for you, as well as a round-up of what's happening next.

Firstly, thank you all, to everyone who's come along so far. There's still space for the final week, so you can still pop by.

A few days have been quiet, but given the lack of precedent for this sort of thing (we believe no-one else has done this before, let alone a daily newspaper), we're not put off. Quieter days have seen people working in our canteen â€“ it overlooks the Regent's Canal, and offers distractions in the form of goslings.

Our busiest days seem to be when there's been a meet-up, or a talk in the evening. We're passionate about technology and host a variety of tech events at our King's Cross office. We've also seen people using the drop-in as a way to avoid [rush hour trains](http://twitter.com/#!/jezhiggins/status/68385758171500544); it's not _just_ the warm-up act for the evening's beer and pizza.

One thing you asked for is a calendar. We've [done this](http://gadaf.fi/gdndi-cal), and if we say so ourselves, the last full week looks pretty good. As you'll see, we do have a couple of speaking slots available.

Additionally, those who've attended, or are due to attend, the drop-ins are invited to come along to the Guardian's daily editorial briefing (during May), at 10am. Spaces **are** limited. If you're interested in coming, please indicate which day) along with your name, email it to [Emma Mulqueeny](mailto:emma.mulqueeny@guardian.co.uk).

The latest events pick up from the skills in-house, on interactive content, more on how [guardian.co.uk](http://www.guardian.co.uk) works, and how machine learning can enable developers to make large sets of text documents more interesting and open to readers.

Times and dates in the [Google Calendar](http://gadaf.fi/gdndi-cal).

We'll be announcing, in the next blog post, more about our special guest(s) for the season finale.

We really hope you might be able to drop-in. We'd like to be able to say that the tech community wants these, and to have the drop-in continue, maybe on a weekly basis.

See you from 4pm throughout working days in May.
