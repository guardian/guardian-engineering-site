Do you enjoy building applications with the latest technologies? Is the cloud somewhere you feel at home? Come work on innovative projects including the Guardian website (which serves up to 1200 pages per second with close to 100% uptime) and the Content API that makes our content available to search and use. Help us take Guardian content to the next level. We have many projects in progress using different technologies ranging from traditional Java, Spring and Hibernate to those using Scala, Lift and Mongodb. In the mobile arena we have native apps on IOS and Android and are looking to increase our use of Html 5. We are always interested in expanding our knowledge and making our software the best it can be.

A solid understanding of developing software products for the web or mobile is more important to us than knowledge of any specific language or tool. We embrace using and contributing to open source software and are keen to hear of any projects you have worked on.

Are you a senior software developer with line management experience?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Guardian is hiring software developers who will take on line management responsibility for a small group of developers who work across multiple projects. 85% of your time will be spent doing hands-on software development, working in agile, cross-functional teams. The other 15% of your time will be line management, which includes mentoring, coaching, training, recruitment and improving the performance of team members.

To apply you should be a talented, hands on software developer with a track record of building and developing confidence and ability in others; you should be great at spotting and nurturing talent.
