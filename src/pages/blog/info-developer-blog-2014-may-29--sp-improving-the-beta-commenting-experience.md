Late last year, we [released an early version](https://www.theguardian.com/help/2013/nov/18/commenting-now-available-on-our-mobile-website) of comments on our beta site, with the aim of getting a basic platform for people to read and comment on our new site. The team have been improving other areas of the site in the meantime.

It's now time to re-focus on the commenting experience on the beta site. Over the next few weeks, the team will be working on the commenting platform. We know that there are features which you expect to see, and we plan on addressing a lot of those requests.

Comments are open on this article, and we'd be happy to discuss the changes to the commenting platform on beta and take on any commenting feedback that you have. We'll also be updating this article with the changes that we're making on comments and what we're working on next. If you want to feed back more broadly about the beta, please use our [feedback link](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/theguardian-beta-feedback).

You can expect smaller changes to be delivered more rapidly over the next few weeks. Keep an eye on the "Coming soon" section to see what we'll be building next.
