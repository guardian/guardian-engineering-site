The Guardian was recently profiled by [Typesafe](http://typesafe.com/), custodians of the Scala programming language, about our use of their technologies to power our web presence. The full paper by our Head of Architecture Graham Tackley is [available on the Typesafe blog](http://blog.typesafe.com/the-guardian-leads-with-typesafe), and an extract can be found below.

Scala programs are compiled directly to Java bytecode that runs on the extremely mature Java Virtual Machine, and leverages the JVM's robust just-in-time compilation, garbage collection, and well understood deployment techniques. The operations team won't see a difference. Developers keep working in their familiar tools, begin writing Scala in a Java format, however they're writing code that's shorter, faster, more scalable, more correct, and even more fun
