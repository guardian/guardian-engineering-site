**How did you begin your product management journey?**

After university, I wasn’t entirely sure what career path to pursue. So I decided to join an exciting startup that allowed me to explore various responsibilities and get exposure to different roles. At that point, I hadn’t even heard of product management! However, I did really enjoy speaking directly with users, conducting interviews to understand their needs, and getting feedback on the products we were building. I was also quite curious about how all the different parts of the business came together to create a product.

Alongside my work, I had been reading some books that gave me a good understanding of product management fundamentals. After over a year at the startup, I landed my first full PM role at a media and events company, taking ownership of the development of their mobile app. That first PM gig was a valuable learning curve and I managed to deliver my first product which was really exciting.

**What does a typical workday involve?**

I like to start my days by heading to our office canteen to soak up some morning sun and peaceful quiet before the rush begins. On the way, I’ll pick up a copy of the day’s freshly-printed newspaper to skim the headlines while ordering a coffee from the friendly barista team. With coffee and newspaper in hand, I’ll open up my laptop and pop a cheery “Good morning!” into the team chat channel since we work in a hybrid model these days.

After exchanging a few messages with the team, I’ll use that first hour to go through emails, review the day’s priorities, and prepare for any upcoming meetings. At 10:45 am, it’s time for the daily standup call where we provide updates on active projects and have a chance to chat with the whole team. The rest of the morning typically consists of a mix of meetings - some check-ins with engineers, designers, and other stakeholders, as well as some strategic discussions about roadmaps and quarterly objectives.

I make sure to block out some “focus time” on my calendar in the afternoons to review or write documentation, strategy work or analysis.

**What is your favourite part of working at the Guardian?**

I remember what I said to my manager at the end of the first week after joining: “Why is everyone so nice to me here?” People are genuinely nice, helpful, and welcoming which was not the case in my previous workplaces. Even a year and a half later, I’m still struck by the friendly and collaborative culture.

Not only are colleagues friendly but they are also smart and committed to the values of the Guardian. They bring an inspiring mix of creativity and passion to initiatives like our Hack Days to dream up innovative ideas for better serving our audiences.

**What made you apply to The Guardian?**

I’d been reading The Guardian for a while and thought their commitment to keeping journalism open to all was especially inspiring. I was also drawn to the idea of working for a company that is revered as a journalistic institution but which also has a great reputation for creating best-in-class digital products. It means I collaborate with a diverse array of talented people across the entire organisation - not just techies and product folks, but also editors, reporters, and many other fascinating roles.
