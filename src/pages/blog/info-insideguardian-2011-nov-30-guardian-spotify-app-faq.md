Why have we built the Spotify app?
----------------------------------

The Guardian and [Spotify](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/spotify) have worked together on this app as we hope it's a great way to discover new music, listen to the latest albums that we are reviewing and then share what you find with your friends.

How do I find the Spotify app?
------------------------------

The Guardian app can be found in [the new App Finder section in the Spotify Player](http://www.spotify.com/uk/blog/archives/2011/11/30/say-hello-to-spotify-apps/). To see this new section you will first need to install [the "preview" version of the Spotify platform](http://www.spotify.com/uk/download/previews/).

What can I do with the app?
---------------------------

Users can read album reviews from the Guardian, listen to those albums, star their favourite tracks and share albums with their friends in Spotify. In the app users will also be directed to the Guardian's website where they can rate or review albums.

Do I need to install the app?
-----------------------------

No, simply browse to the app in Spotify; you don't need to install it or uninstall it. If you like the app you can find it in your Spotify music player whenever you'd like to use it.
