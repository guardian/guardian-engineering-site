Update
------

I'm happy to say that we've now launched the new apps.

You can find out about [more about them here](https://www.theguardian.com/guardianapp). In addition, Wolfgang Blau has written [a great article](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/29/the-guardian-launches-new-apps-to-support-its-global-growth-strategy) about how these new apps fit into our whole approach, while Tanya Cordrey has a [really useful overview](https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2014/may/29/guardian-app-android-iphone-ipad-tablet) of everything you can find inside.

But if you want to just try them out for yourself, you can get the app for iPad and iPhone on the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-guardian/id409128287?mt=8), and for Android phones and tablets from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guardian).

Original article
----------------

For the past 12 months, a team of designers, developers, testers, editors and digital experts have been working on completely new versions of our live app. We’re now very close to launching, in fact it’s coming this week.

If you’re an existing iPhone or Android user, the new app will be delivered to you as an update.

So we wanted to give you a first look at how we have developed our app, and to let you know what to expect.

Developing in the open
----------------------

We take the utmost care to listen to our users. Since the beginning of this project we've have worked hand-in-hand with a great many people who enjoy using our app.

From inviting users in to preview and comment on our work, to running a beta programme with almost 10,000 people, we’ve developed our new app as openly and collaboratively as possible.

With feedback and data from literally thousands of different people, we hope that we’ve created something that everyone can enjoy.

More beautiful and more varied
------------------------------

Since we first launched our iPhone app four years ago, the market, technology, users and their devices have radically changed. From the introduction of the first iPad to the explosion of Android devices, to the popularity of large-screen phones; we now have to make sure our content looks and works beautifully no matter what device it’s on.

Our new app is designed and built to look great. It moves us far beyond simple lists of news into a world where the importance of stories, type and pace of content, and the work of our journalists are all appropriately highlighted to you - making an experience that’s more varied and more responsive to the news as it happens. It does this on every device - a truly responsive experience for everyone.

In addition, the new app now displays the breadth of content we produce, from standard articles to special features; and from interactive content to embedded elements like YouTube videos and tweets. So you’ll now get more exciting, varied, and rich content too.

More adaptive and more personal
-------------------------------

Personalisation has been a huge success in our current app. For our new one, we’ve listened to suggestions from our users and evolved the opportunities you’ll have to make the app really yours. From personal alerts to an unlimited homescreen - we’ve aimed to create the most personal experience Guardian users have ever had.

Launching this week
-------------------

The new app is launching this week for Android 4 and iOS7. So if you’re an existing iOS or Android user you'll see an update soon. But that’s not the end of the project. It’s the beginning of more innovation and evolution. The new app is the foundation for our future in apps - so it’ll keep getting even better.
