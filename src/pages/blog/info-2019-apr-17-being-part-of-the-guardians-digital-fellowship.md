The Guardian’s Digital Fellowship programme gives new developers an opportunity to spend a year rotating around several development teams so that they can gain exposure to different technologies, build relationships throughout the department, and work out where their interests lie. As this year’s fellows come to the end of their first rotation, they reflect on their experiences so far.

Being Part of a Dev Team
------------------------

I’m Simone, and I currently work on the Guardian’s apps. I used to work in book publishing, and after discovering online coding courses in my spare time I decided to change careers, via a three-month bootcamp with Makers Academy. My first rotation on the Fellowship was on the Android team, and I am now spending three months with the iOS team. One of the things I love about working here is how quickly you are involved in the work of your team. Before joining the Guardian, I had never done any mobile development, but I was still able to merge a pull request (admittedly, a small one) on my very first day! Many of my tickets so far have been UI-related, and it’s very exciting to be able to see my changes rolled out to production so quickly.

Each team’s workflow is designed to best suit its needs and members, but many teams follow a two-week Agile lifecycle. On the apps team, we have fortnightly planning sessions, where we select tickets from the backlog to work on over the next two weeks based on the current priorities, demo our progress to the rest of the apps team and our stakeholders once a fortnight, and reflect regularly on the work we’ve done in retros. Our daily standups are also a great opportunity to hear about what everyone else is currently working on, and ensure that knowledge isn’t siloed. We work very closely with UX designers and researchers, which is fascinating and really helps bring the work we do to life.

As fellows, we are really well supported within our teams: I have a tech guide on the team who I work most closely with on a day-to-day basis – together, we identify tickets for me to work on, discuss any potential issues that might arise with it, and often pair on the implementation. Everyone’s work is always reviewed by another member of the team, and this often generates fascinating conversations about best practice. I also have regular meetings with my mentor and my line manager about my general development and progression – as a new developer, it feels very reassuring to have so many opportunities to discuss how I’m doing on a regular basis.

Being Part of the Digital Department
------------------------------------

I’m Vanessa and I’m on the Editorial Tools team for my first rotation. I made a career switch into software development, first enrolling in an intensive coding bootcamp and then applying for the Guardian’s Digital Fellowship because of its emphasis on learning on the job. I was looking for an opportunity where I could grow and be challenged, and so far have not been disappointed! Six months into the Fellowship, I’ve discovered the amazing learning environment nurtured by the Digital Department.

There are weekly Learning Groups and “Tech Time” presentations – one of the hardest lessons for me so far has been how to be more selective of what I attend, as there are so many options! Topics covered range from the practical (Build an iOS app in an hour) to the hotly debated (Should the Guardian adopt Go?) and highly conceptual (The First DNA computer). These take place during working hours so you never need to skip lunch or stay late, and everyone in the department is encouraged to attend because continued learning is built into the engineering culture at all levels.

A large part of the Guardian’s backend codebase is written in Scala, so I was worried I might only be able to work on frontend knowing just JavaScript. This was unfounded thanks to regular “Scala School” sessions to teach both new and experienced devs the language, starting with basic types through to frameworks. Scala School has been one of my favourite experiences so far, and I am grateful and impressed by the time my colleagues dedicate to making these and other learning opportunities happen.

In addition, the department has a conference budget and so far I’ve been able to attend three: _MuCon_ (stretching the boundaries of my knowledge), MozFest’s _OpenNews Unconference on Journalism Tech_ (helping me understand the technical challenges particular to news media) and _You Got This_ (about all the non-technical skills needed for early career devs) along with other Associate Devs at the Guardian.

These have all proven to be not just great ways to learn, but a chance to meet and interact with developers at all levels from across the Digital Department, making a large team feel a bit smaller and very welcoming.

Being Part of the Guardian
--------------------------

I’m Frankie, and I currently work on the Commercial Development team. Working at the Guardian feels like working with your family, there is such a community spirit that sometimes you forget it’s a place of work. I’ve been at the Guardian for over 4 years in various roles and worked in different departments with lots of different people, but joining the Digital Fellowship has been a completely new experience. I developed an interest in digital and started teaching myself to code, and through support and encouragement in my personal development, the Guardian opened up the opportunity for me to have a complete career change. It has been overwhelmingly positive and one of the reasons why I love working here so much.

There are great opportunities for mentoring too: a company-wide mentoring programme was introduced this year prioritising women at the early stage of their careers, and within the digital department many colleagues are willing to become mentors – I have two! It can give you the chance to share knowledge and experiences, discuss career goals, foster new relationships and learn new skills or ways of doing things.

Aside from work, there are also lots of extra things to be involved in. Morning conference is always a good reminder of why I work here, and the values that we strive for, there are sometimes really inspirational guest speakers too. But be sure to get there early, you might find yourself squashed in the corner with your knees tucked under your chin – it can get busy!

If films are a thing of interest to you then you will love the exclusive staff screenings of the short documentaries produced by the Guardian, including the Oscar-nominated “Black Sheep”. It’s certainly a different way to spend your lunchtime.

There are also lots of fun things to enjoy: a lunchtime board games club, netball and football teams, take part in mindfulness sessions, learn French or Italian, knitting club, the Guardian choir (The Guardian Angels) and many more! Whatever your interest I’m pretty certain there is a group of people that are interested in the same thing. These are just some of the reasons why working at the Guardian is so special, I can’t imagine working anywhere else.
