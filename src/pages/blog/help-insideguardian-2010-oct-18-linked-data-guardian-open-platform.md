This morning we've added a new feature to our [Open Platform Content API](http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform). You can now search through our available content by using ISBN numbers and MusicBrainz IDs. The API will return content about books and music artists that we have tagged with these external identifiers.

It is the first time that we have used Linked Data in this way, to allow you to use an identifier supplied by a third party to locate Guardian and Observer content. I've blogged a little more about it [over on the Open Platform blog](http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform/blog/references-in-api).

If you want to get to grips with this new feature and start using it, then we've compiled [a brief guide and FAQ to using 'references'](http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform/blog/reference-api-faq) in the Open Platform Content API.

We are already seeing examples of it in use. [Ripped Records](http://www.rippedrecords.com/), a website that tracks upcoming gigs and shows in Edinburgh and Glasgow have added Guardian & Observer reviews to their artist pages - here is the one for [LCD Soundsystem](http://www.rippedrecords.com/artists/lcd-soundsystem/).

Finally, the developer who has done much of the work, [Daithí Ó Crualaoich](http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/daithi-o-crualaoich), has also [blogged about what we've done](http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform/blog/linked-data-open-platform), why we chose to do it using the technologies that we have, and what we hope you'll be able to build on the back of our first foray into Linked Data.
