[Young Rewired State](https://youngrewiredstate.org) (YRS) is a spin-off of the popular hack event group [Rewired State](http://rewiredstate.org/), aimed at budding developers and designers aged 18 or below. YRS run a variety of events around the country, but its calendar is dominated by the annual [Festival of Code](https://youngrewiredstate.org/festival-of-code): a week-long hackathon culminating in a weekend of show-and-tell, talks and celebration at Birmingham's Custard Factory.

Four of the Guardian's Digital Development team went along as mentors to see what the next generation of creative techies were up to. This blogpost offers a conversational overview from the Guardian staff about what we learned from our participation in YRS 2013, grouped by topic.

Groups, ideas and structure
---------------------------

**Will**: The scope and ambitiousness of the projects was really impressive. All of the groups had come up with really interesting and complex problems to solve. They also seemed fairly coordinated within their teams and had split the work into well defined front- and back-ends.

**Alastair**: I was there on day one for my Eastbourne crew, so the ideas were pretty broad at that point. They knew they wanted to do a map based game, using [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) APIs and GPS. The team of four were thinking about an augmented reality 'coin catcher' game by about 11am on Monday. Augmented reality? The word 'constraint' didn't really apply.

My session with them was for about 4 hours, and I decided to run a ['product box'](http://innovationgames.com/product-box/) session. The idea was to ensure they'd thought about the final product they were trying to build, along with some functionality. We asked them to pitch their boxes, which helped focus minds on the task.

**Jenny**: Matt, Will and I attended a centre at [One KX](http://www.onekx.org.uk/). There were four groups with one creating [TwitHunt](http://www.twithunt.byethost31.com/) using both Twitter and [Sentiment 140](http://www.sentiment140.com/) to gauge how positive or negative a word currently is on Twitter. Another group developed [TrendCast](http://justdubstep.com/), which linked the [Markit](http://www.markit.com/en/) API, the Guardian's [Content API](https://www.theguardian.com/open-platform) and [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) to give users information on a company's stocks with an indication to buy or sell.

[Mortune](http://hacks.youngrewiredstate.org/events/YRS2013/mortune) won the award for best example of design at YRS and aimed to bring relevant suggestions for music searches. We also saw [PiCycle](http://hacks.youngrewiredstate.org/events/YRS2013/picycle), which was programmed with Python and used a Raspberry Pi, GPS tracking tools and LEDs mounted on a bike to help navigation when cycling. This was an impressive effort and we were happy to see this work win Best in Show.

Technology
----------

**Matt**: One of the things which impressed me most was the attention paid to mobile. Almost every app or website had either a mobile-friendly design, or a counterpart mobile app. At least one group was using Twitter Bootstrap which meant they had responsive design baked in from the start, but either way, it was great to hear it was something they were thinking about.

**Jenny**: I was happy to see many of the groups use APIs to access data and use GitHub and Google Drive to work collaboratively. We use these tools every day in the industry and to see students understand their relevance was a nice surprise.

**Will**: My first task was to help resolve a merge conflict which took me completely by surprise, I hadn't really expected the groups to be using any sort of version control. Then I found out that most of the kids had already heard of StackOverflow and I realised I wasn't going to need to help these kids much!

**Matt**: I'd half expected to be doing some kind of git evangelising, but it turned out most groups had either heard of it and were using it, or had decided it wasn't worth the effort and were using Google Drive instead – quite pragmatically, in my opinion.

Group diversity
---------------

**Matt**: There was a fairly diverse mixture of people attending the One KX centre, with around 20% female attendance. There was also an encouraging range of ages, with at least one team consisting of kids aged 10-16 or thereabouts.

**Jenny**: While we all only visited one centre, it did seem that the group represented the industry standard of more males to females in attendance. In addition, we saw that the males led the coding of the sites and applications and the females gave valuable advice on design with wireframes and presentation. I'd really like to see more women enter the industry and would recommend groups such as YRS to continue to encourage more women to join and give coding a go.

The future
----------

**Will**: Given that all the kids had volunteered to be there, predicting the future is obviously going to be biased. Having said that, it definitely feels like we're going to be seeing more [moments like this](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/25/summly-sold-yahoo-teenage-creator) in the future.

**Matt**: It was really inspiring to see a bunch of motivated young people completely unfazed by the breadth and depth of technology available to work with. In that regard I'm excited (and perhaps a little nervous) for what the future will bring when these kids grow up and get jobs.

Hopefully they got a taster for how building digital products work, and some of them even started encountering problems of scalability and architecture while we were there – if they go home and start learning about these topics then the developers of the future will be something to reckon with.

What we got out of the day
--------------------------

**Alastair**: Having not taught groups of kids before, I had to work really hard to communicate clearly to an audience not familiar with user experience. It was a fun challenge. I think I would have liked them to be a bit more inquisitive though – they were a bit hard work at times!

The most striking thing for me was the level of understanding about APIs, data, version control etc. One of the first things I saw was one of the kids trying to understand how a page was put together using Chrome's Web Inspector. Also impressive was the thinking, and the lack of constraints. What would happen if you applied their thoughts to news and story telling?

**Will**: I found the day really inspirational. Its amazing to see how passionate these kids were about what they were doing and how much they already knew about the subject. In 10 years time they are going to be competing for the same jobs as me and job security terms, that's actually quite a scary prospect.

**Alastair**: You should be scared.

How to get involved
-------------------

**Jenny**: YRS are always looking for mentors to help at events. We all volunteered for one day during the week but many others volunteer for the whole week. You can find out about events on [Young Rewired State](https://youngrewiredstate.org/) or follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/youngrewired). Another great organisation that is run by volunteers across the country is [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) which aims to teach programming in after school clubs.

**Will**: There are also loads of ways for budding programmers to get involved. Talk to your school about schemes like Code Club, get involved with some open-source projects (you can find loads on [GitHub](https://github.com/)), get together with your friends and work together on something. Bug fixing is another great way to get started, so if you've found a problem, look for ways to fix it! Everything you need to get started is free and the internet is full of help for when you get stuck. Good luck!
