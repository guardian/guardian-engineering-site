Today we are unveiling [a Guardian app for the new Spotify platform](http://www.spotify.com/uk/blog/archives/2011/11/30/say-hello-to-spotify-apps/) which means that Spotify users can read and listen to the latest [Guardian and Observer album reviews](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/music+tone/albumreview).

Spotify has today launched a new version of its popular music platform which allows companies like the Guardian to build apps that make it easier to discover new music on [Spotify](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/spotify).

The Guardian Spotify app shows our latest music reviews and gives users the ability to listen to tracks, star rate them and then share the music with their friends. We hope it's a great way for Guardian and Spotify users to discover new music and to share and discuss what they find.

The app has been built using the Guardian's [Open Platform](http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform). Music reviews from our Content API are matched to Spotify tracks and then our latest reviews are shown to users of the app.

To see the app Spotify users will need to be using [the "preview version" of its new platform](http://www.spotify.com/uk/download/previews/).

We hope you enjoy the app â€“ please take a look and tell us what you think.
