The Guardian Developer blog is going to be hosting December's "[Carnival of journalism](http://carnivalofjournalism.com/)". Once a month a group of people interested in the future of journalism get together and write blog posts about the same topic, chosen by a different host each time. Previous topics have included [using new tools and gadgets](http://carnivalofjournalism.com/2011/10/31/a-halloween-carnival-of-sorts/), the [role of online video in the newsroom](http://carnivalofjournalism.com/2011/10/04/october-round-up-a-stroll-down-the-midway-at-the-carnival-of-journalism/), [Google+](http://carnivalofjournalism.com/2011/08/31/carnival-of-journalism-wrap-google/) and a [carnival of #fail](http://carnivalofjournalism.com/2011/05/09/carnival-of-fail-jcarn-roundup-4/).

How does it work?
-----------------

You can join the Carnival of Journalism by filling out [this form](http://digidave.wufoo.com/forms/s7x2p7/). Or have a look at the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/carnival-of-journalism). Simply write and publish a blog post on the stated deadline on the topic proposed, and let us know about it by leaving a comment below. We'll then feature you in round-up blog post the week after the deadline, also on this blog.

With it being December, we thought we would adopt a Christmas theme for this month's topic – and pick something, in keeping with being hosted by a Developer blog, that we could ask of both technologists and journalists.

If you are a journalist, what would be the best present from programmers and developers that Santa Claus could leave under your Christmas tree?

And, correspondingly, if you are a programmer or developer, what would be the best present from journalism that Father Christmas could deliver down your chimney?

Carnival day next month is going to be Friday 9 December – so get thinking about the topic, publish your blog post on the day, and pop a link into the comments below.
