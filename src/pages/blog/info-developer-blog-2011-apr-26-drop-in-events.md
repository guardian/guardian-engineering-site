Following on from the [last blog post](http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/apr/11/drop-ins) – thanks to all who've signed up – we've been working on getting a few speakers to entice you further.

Working with speakers, agents, and colleagues in the Guardian (from a variety of teams) the first line-up of [#GDNdi](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23GDNdi) events can now be announced.

If you're signed up to a drop-in on the respective day(s) then a seat is already reserved for you. If you would like to attend any of these events without signing up to a drop-in then just follow the link to the event itself and sign up that way.

*   [DevNest](http://devnest.org) on **Tuesday 3 May** will be the UK's largest independent Twitter developer and startup-centric meet-up (sponsored by the Guardian Open Platform, Amazon Web Services and Multizone). It's aimed at those interested in the technology behind rea-time information networks like Twitter, or those intending to start building applications that use them in the future.
*   The [Redis London Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Redis-London/events/17342904/) on **Wednesday 4 May** will focus on using Redis and production, and will feature Reza Lotun ([TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/)) and Martyn Loughran ([Pusher](http://pusher.com/)) both of whom will talk about their experiences of using Redis
*   [CloudCamp](http://londondevops.eventwax.com/cloud-talks) on **Tuesday 10 May** will highlight some of the pros and cons of using a platform as a service through two talks. It's aimed squarely at developers and sysadmins interested in low-down technical details.
*   Sanj Matharu from Vodafone will be talking to developers on **Thursday 12 May** about the future of mobile. If you want to sign up to this event but not the drop-in on that day then [add your name to the Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2011/gdndi-12/).

We're still hunting for interesting speakers (these talks will all be short), so if you'd like to give a talk please [get in touch](mailto:adam.mcgreggor@guardian.co.uk).

We're trying to update the [@GDNdi Twitter stream](http://twitter.com/#!/GDNdi) as things happen. Follow us for more information and to talk to us.

Each drop-in is now also on [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com). [Search for "Guardian Developer Network Drop-in"](http://lanyrd.com/search/?q=Guardian+Developer+Network+Drop-in), or manipulate _[http://lanyrd.com/2011/gdndi-03/](http://lanyrd.com/2011/gdndi-03/)_ to match the date.

There's still time and space to [sign-up](http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/apr/11/drop-ins) if you'd like to drop in. We look forward to seeing you.
