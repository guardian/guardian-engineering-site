Throughout 2016, we have learnt a lot building and maintaining the various systems that power the Guardian. As Christmas nears, we thought that we would share some of that knowledge with the wider world.

For the next twenty five days, as Christmas nears, and the days continue to draw in, we’re going to be publishing one post a day on the developer blog.

We’ll write about compression algorithms, design, testing, machine learning, breaking the site, culture and more. Contributors come from all parts of our Digital Team.

We hope you find it educational and entertaining.

You can follow our progress here on the [Developer Blog](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog), or by following our Twitter handle: [https://twitter.com/gdndevelopers](https://twitter.com/gdndevelopers).
