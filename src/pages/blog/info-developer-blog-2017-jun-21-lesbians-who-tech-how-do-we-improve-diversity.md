The digital development department’s [Diversity and Inclusion Group](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2016/dec/19/introducing-the-guardian-digitals-self-organised-diversity-inclusion-group) works to ensure we live our values and is constantly looking for new and innovative ways to do this. Attending [Lesbians Who Tech](https://lesbianswhotech.org) (LWT) was a really valuable opportunity to hear how other companies are trying to improve the diversity of their workforce. While LWT is a series of conferences for queer women, the practical advice offered by its speakers can be seen as transferable to other underrepresented groups.

There are two parts to improving diversity, attracting a wider range of candidates and developing a company culture to ensure you retain them. [Leanne Pittsford’s](https://twitter.com/lepitts) [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcAbPYwwoio) included the staggering statistic that in the past five years $1.2 billion has been spent by tech companies on diversity. In spite of this the tech industry is still dominated by people who are all a bit the same. It seems that money alone is not enough to change the face of the tech industry.

The focus of multiple talks at LWT was rethinking the recruitment process. We need to address the fact that many companies rely on their existing networks and recommendations from employees when seeking out new recruits. The problem is that the people in our networks tend to look a lot like us. Users of [include.io](https://include.io/) receive a half an hour mentoring session from someone in the industry who can then choose to recommend them, offering an alternative way for people to get recommended when they don’t have connections. The Guardian’s [Fellowship Scheme](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2016/dec/08/guardian-digital-fellowship-2017) offers another approach to this problem, offering a route into the tech industry for people with a [range of backgrounds](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/developer-blog/2016/jun/24/coming-in-from-the-cold-routes-to-becoming-a-software-engineer).

[August Public Inc](http://aug.co/) found that the candidates who discovered their roles through their sponsorship of Another Round podcast were more diverse than those who came through general enquiries. Their advice for getting more diverse applicants was to sponsor unconventional tech spaces.

Offering opportunities to join a diverse team seems like an area where startups and smaller tech teams like the Guardian can really compete with large tech companies when trying to attract high quality recruits. It is far easier to build a diverse team from scratch rather than trying to retrospectively do so when you’re 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 employees in.

August Public Inc’s has an impressive approach to openness. In their [publicly available drive](http://public.aug.co/) they share their [diversity statistics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1slZdoTYi8dHV5EU84aorV9AaA_xxrVq8QGzNdhkWXo4/edit) as well as reports on their approaches to hiring and retention. No individual company currently has the solution to recruiting and retention and more knowledge sharing across the industry is a valuable way to collaborate on a solution.

Whilst [Krys Burnette](https://twitter.com/Krys_Burnette) focused in her talk on how to improve the diversity of people applying for roles Elena Grewal from the data science team at AirBnB outlined her team’s [investigation](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/beginning-with-ourselves-48c5ed46a703#.h4jlko4q6) into the effect of the interview process on gender diversity. The data science team looked at each stage of their four stage interview process to see if the gender breakdown remained consistent at all stages. They found that there were some stages that proportionally less women succeeded in passing. When looking at the assessment at those stages they saw there was potential for unconscious bias. To address this they provided a much more objective scoring system for interviewers and also made sure that the interview panels were made up of a more diverse group of people. The team saw that both of these actions lead to the gender breakdown remaining more consistent throughout the interview process and more women being hired.

At the Guardian we have worked hard on our recruitment process to ensure that it is what you know not who you know that leads to success when applying. We have [open sourced our pairing tests](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2016/jan/20/the-guardians-new-pairing-exercises) and also documented our [hiring process](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2015/jan/20/how-does-the-guardian-recruit-developers) to try and ensure everyone interviewing us has the same information about how we recruit.

Recruitment alone is not enough to change the face of a company, retention is also a key aspect of developing a diverse team. The importance of Employee Resource Groups (ERG) was brought up in multiple talks. This is a term that is not widely used in the UK, and while the exact role of an ERG varies from company to company, the three common purposes were:

*   to provide a professional network for underrepresented groups and allies.
*   to lobby and push for changes within the company.
*   to do outreach within the local community.

Giving your employees a platform to inform you of their concerns as well as a place to find people who have shared experiences is important for retention. Although a flaw in this framework is that to get one established requires buy in from someone senior in the company.

Hazel Havard from Workday outlined practical steps a company can take to improve work culture for trans women. She highlighted just how important it is to be proactive in order to be an inclusive culture, for example implementing policies and training as a preemptive action rather than as a reactionary response. Another part of this proactive approach is making sure that things actually get done and setting deadlines for implementation of practical change in order to show your employees you take diversity issues seriously.

How to make the tech industry more diverse is not an easy problem to solve and there are many theories on why there’s such a lack of diversity and how we can improve it. The message from many of these talks was the importance of focusing on all groups that are underrepresented rather than trying to improve the diversity at your company one group at a time. “Turning up for each other” was a recurring theme throughout the conference. Diversity should be something that everyone is invested in and it should not be considered the sole responsibility of underrepresented groups to fix.
