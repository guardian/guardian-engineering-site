We launched the standalone Eyewitness app for the original iPad in 2010 as a way for our readers to enjoy the best of the Guardian’s famous photojournalism from ‘Eyewitness’ on a tablet. The launch of the iPad offered a new and unique opportunity to showcase our pictures, and over the past four years we’ve delivered a new photo every day.

As apps, devices, and our own portfolio of products evolve we have concentrated on delivering our content in the best possible ways. After over a year’s development, our new apps launched earlier this year, and include support for our Eyewitness photography series. As such, we’re no longer actively supporting the Eyewitness app and it will stop getting new images from Monday 15 September.

We look at every one of our products regularly to see if they’re still delivering the user experiences, and return, that we’d want. For Eyewitness, we now have better, more exciting, and more engaging ways for our users to get our photojournalism. It makes sense for us to concentrate on these.

How you can continue to enjoy Guardian photography
--------------------------------------------------

Our new app, designed specially for iPads, as well as other tablets, allows you to pick and choose what content you see on your homepage. Even better, it allows you to _‘follow’_ series you really like.

When you use follow, we send personal alerts when we publish a new article or gallery about your favourite topics. So if you love our Eyewitness series of photos, simply follow these steps to continue to enjoy them:

*   If you’ve not already done so, download and install the [new Guardian app for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-guardian/id409128287?mt=8)  
    
*   Once you’ve opened it, goto search (it’s at the bottom of the navigation pane on the left)

*   Tap on ‘Follow series’ on the top-left. Now we’ll send you an alert each day when there’s a new Eyewitness photo to enjoy

If you don’t want alerts, you can follow the instructions above, but instead of tapping on ‘_follow series_’, instead tap on the ‘_add to home_’ icon on the top-right. This will add Eyewitness to your homepage, so you can see the latest photos every time you open the app.

Lastly, if you like Eyewitness, you might want to search for and follow ‘_Best photographs of the day_’ for even more of our fantastic photojournalism.

We know that many users enjoy the Eyewitness app. And we hope that you can all continue to enjoy our photos, more of them in fact, delivered to you in a more personal way, in our new app.

As always, if you have any questions or comments please add them below, or tweet @guardianmobile.
