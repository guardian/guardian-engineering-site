We run frequent [tech retrospectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective#Software_development) in the Guardian’s Product and Engineering department to enable teams to learn and adapt. Some are fortnightly team retros to understand what works well and what changes should be made, while others are organised after technical incidents to learn how to avoid something similar happening again. Since retrospectives are so ingrained in our culture it seemed a logical progression to run a retro that was not for the typical fortnight or for a quarter, but for an entire decade.

After some thought and discussion with others I concluded that the focus should be on innovation. What innovations were successfully developed in the past decade? What and who were the key moments, key people, barriers and success factors for each of them?

I sent a questionnaire to past and present colleagues and asked them to list their top three innovations and to break down how, from their perspective, they came into being. I analysed and clustered the responses and wrote a document that I hope reflects the opinions of the people that generously filled in the questionnaire. That document has in turn been used to input into discussions within the senior leadership teams to shape the next decade.

Below is an overview of those innovations and the people and factors that helped – and hindered – their coming into existence.

While I initially did this work for the benefit of the Guardian, I hope that everyone can learn something from our reflections.

**The data**

I collected responses from nearly 30 current and ex-colleagues. There was a wide range of seniority from junior to c-suite as well as the full gamut of disciplines in our department, including engineers, product, QA and leadership.

They were each asked to list up to three innovations (without any prompts). Seven innovations were mentioned particularly frequently in the responses, accompanied by accounts of how they came about and what factors helped or hindered their developments.

There isn’t room to dive into these in detail but let’s quickly describe them:

*   The Guardian’s in-house analytics platform, Ophan, was the most frequently mentioned. It came out of an introduction between an engineer and a member of editorial. It was initially a “hack day” project that was subsequently allowed space to be developed fully.
    
*   The adoption of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) cloud services and the simultaneous move from a central operations team to teams owning and operating their products. Both of these were significant changes to the status quo and engendered a big change to the way we worked.
    
*   Next was the rollout of [continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) for all products, allowing product teams to ship their own code, greatly accelerating the pace of feature rollout, and fundamentally changing how teams operated.
    
*   Fourth most frequently mentioned was the [responsive website relaunch](https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2014/oct/29/the-guardian-unveils-newly-redesigned-theguardiancom-to-us-readers) that was built on top of the [Content API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/). It was significantly faster, more scalable and more reliable than the [R2](https://www.theguardian.com/help/series/an-abc-of-r2) system it replaced.
    
*   In fifth, the creation of a suite of best-in-class tools for editorial to use to create and deliver content. Our Composer publishing tool revolutionised the way content was authored in the newsroom, and the [Grid image manager](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2015/aug/12/open-sourcing-grid-image-service) resulted in vastly reduced spend on picture rights.
    
*   The sixth most mentioned innovation was contributions (which we introduced from 2016 onwards, both on a monthly/recurring and one-off basis) and digital subscriptions. Our evidence-led approach was built on the strong relationship we have with our readers and has the Guardian’s distinctive journalism and ethos at its centre.
    
*   The final innovation was the development of the Guardian’s [Content API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/), which is at the heart of our publishing pipeline and was an early pioneer of the increasingly common [headless content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system) architectural pattern.

For each innovation the questionnaire featured questions about what factors helped or hindered its development. Ten main clusters emerged, with the largest clusters being around culture, empowerment, and talent and people.

Being a broad theme, culture was the biggest of these. Some examples include a strong sense of trust and safety in the department. The move to ensure that people from the broader organisation were included in the innovation culture of the engineering department was also considered a significant change that helped innovation. Another specific example: hack days were viewed positively – in terms of them being a great collaboration method, but also challenging for some, because ideas from hack days often required the space to be explored or developed further.

Almost as big as culture was a cluster around empowerment of engineers and other staff. The approach of trusting people to understand the higher purpose and giving them space was cited as a largely positive influence.

The final cluster to mention is talent and people. The answers here were overwhelmingly positive, and made it clear that talent was considered exceptional, and people had a strong drive, due partly to a belief in the organisation.

**What’s next**

My aim of taking a retrospective on the past decade was to help the Guardian as an organisation understand how innovation occurred during that time, and thereby to nurture the next decade’s innovations.

There are already lots of exciting projects and more coming along in the near future. Quite frankly, it is impossible to know whether the projects we work on today will be seen as pivotal innovations in a few years time, but it is always interesting to speculate.

The Guardian’s website team are getting to the final stages of the [Dotcom Rendering project](https://www.theguardian.com/info/2019/dec/08/migrating-the-guardian-website-to-react); the design system team have made huge progress with [Source](https://theguardian.design/); our developer experience team are working on how to make ownership of products less onerous; the [investigations and reporting team](https://www.theguardian.com/info/2021/jan/12/how-technology-is-powering-environmental-reporting) means developers are now collaborating at the heart of our journalism; and our editorial tools team are [making life easier for journalists and stories better for readers](https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2020/nov/20/introducing-typerighter-making-life-easier-for-journalists-and-stories-better-for-readers).

So what things will we look back on? We’ll have to get to work and find out!

_**Development of digital products is central to the Guardian. You could be building the products that showcase our progressive and independent journalism, crafting the tools that journalists use to write their stories, developing the services that allow those stories to be distributed across the globe, or safeguarding our financial future.**_
