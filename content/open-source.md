# Open Source

We at the Guardian try to be [as open and transparent as
possible](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2014/nov/28/developing-in-the-open).
That means developing in public repositories where anyone can see our work. You can explore our
source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/guardian).

## What we work with

### Languages

- [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
