When I was younger I didn’t necessarily feel as if I knew what I was talking about and I think the beauty of ageing is you just grow into yourself. A lot of the people I work with in the UX space are women which is really encouraging. Overall, you need to be someone that is more personable and good at listening. This is something that is so important when you’re interviewing someone in a focus group or for a piece of research, to be able to form a relationship with a stranger and put them at ease in order to get the best from them.</p>","elementId":"b2f8e88d-b4ab-47d6-b411-a82ea0d8b5cf"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p><strong>Typically what does a day look like for you?</strong></p>","elementId":"56b9487a-9287-4de9-8242-a18d1b041aa6"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>It is very dependent on the project that I’m working on at the time, but it can be a mixture of chaos and trying to smooth that out, over and over again. When I am doing research for a project I’ll have the research objectives in front of me and then (as any UX person will tell you) I live and die by a Post-it note. Once I go through the transcript of the call I highlight the interesting or important parts and I put them on Post-its all over my wall and I identify any significant themes that way. From that it grows into telling a story, which can be in the form of a presentation. I prefer it to this way as research can often fall a bit flat if it’s just a report with numbers, and the information may be lost on people who aren’t research literate. I think it’s best to tell a story because, as humans, we are natural storytellers and it lands better. When I’m doing preparation work I always check in with stakeholders to make sure we’re clear on the objectives and ask for feedback on discussion guides. Actually, doing the research means calls all day and then I would sit down with my team and we would watch clips and discuss and analyse.</p>","elementId":"906307b3-b8f3-4340-8077-ab737628004d"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p><strong>Do you have any advice for anyone interested to get into UX research</strong>?</p>","elementId":"25c0369d-ba19-4153-b403-157ecf9fdf6f"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>I want to stress that you don’t have to study design or computer science to get into UX.
