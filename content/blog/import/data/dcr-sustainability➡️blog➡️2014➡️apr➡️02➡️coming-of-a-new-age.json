There are a great deal of healthy, energetic, and financially independent people, who want services simply to spice up their lives. Services which, if produced in a more accessible way (using language and design which is more familiar and understandable), could lead this generation to have more active and valuable social lives and maintain their independence for longer. This leads to a continuation of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/may/21/sociable-housing-older-people-community\">better lifestyle</a>, not only physically but – arguably more importantly – mentally.</p>","elementId":"e2af3216-06d5-4c05-bba3-156a29fbb163"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>Throughout the weekend we conversed with two particularly powerful characters, Robin and Ruth. Robin, 62, ran her own financial advice company. Most of her clients were around her age or older and she showed no signs of wanting to retire any time soon. She used technology throughout her day, as any businesswoman would. Keeping herself up to date with the financial industry, using email and Skype for business and personal communication. She used technology and the internet functionally, but saw little leisure value in it, bar the news and occasionally iPlayer.

This seems to create a mutually beneficial feedback loop. The volunteer, whilst caring for someone’s needs, in turn learns first hand about situations that might arise for them in their coming years. And whilst may seem like an efficient self-sustaining ecosystem, there is something amiss with people who are entering their golden years looking after the elderly.
