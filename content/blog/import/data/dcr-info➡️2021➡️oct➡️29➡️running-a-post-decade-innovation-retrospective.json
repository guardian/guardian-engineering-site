Both of these were significant changes to the status quo and engendered a big change to the way we worked.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Next was the rollout of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery\">continuous delivery</a> for all products, allowing product teams to ship their own code, greatly accelerating the pace of feature rollout, and fundamentally changing how teams operated.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Fourth most frequently mentioned was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2014/oct/29/the-guardian-unveils-newly-redesigned-theguardiancom-to-us-readers\">responsive website relaunch</a> that was built on top of the <a href=\"https://open-platform.theguardian.com/\">Content API</a>. It was significantly faster, more scalable and more reliable than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/series/an-abc-of-r2\">R2</a> system it replaced.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>In fifth, the creation of a suite of best-in-class tools for editorial to use to create and deliver content. Our Composer publishing tool revolutionised the way content was authored in the newsroom, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2015/aug/12/open-sourcing-grid-image-service\">Grid image manager</a> resulted in vastly reduced spend on picture rights.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The sixth most mentioned innovation was contributions (which we introduced from 2016 onwards, both on a monthly/recurring and one-off basis) and digital subscriptions. Our evidence-led approach was built on the strong relationship we have with our readers and has the Guardian’s distinctive journalism and ethos at its centre.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The final innovation was the development of the Guardian’s <a href=\"https://open-platform.theguardian.com/\">Content API</a>, which is at the heart of our publishing pipeline and was an early pioneer of the increasingly common <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system\">headless content management system</a> architectural pattern.</p></li>\n</ul>","elementId":"12fa9668-3399-40f9-bf06-28ef509c406a"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>For each innovation the questionnaire featured questions about what factors helped or hindered its development.

Some examples include a strong sense of trust and safety in the department.
