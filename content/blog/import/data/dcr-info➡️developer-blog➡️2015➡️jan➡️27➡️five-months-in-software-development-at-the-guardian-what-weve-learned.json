Problems can occur across multiple applications, and there’s almost never logging in place exactly where you need it. It’s important to be able to make use of the information that is available to diagnose an issue, and try to include logging in the most useful places when writing code. Pre-production environments are good, being able to run a system locally is even better, making testing and debugging much faster.</p>","elementId":"f27731c7-e507-4f37-9d4a-4319934845c3"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p><strong>Agile development is cool.</strong> The most stressful part of any job is dealing with deadlines. These are often established at the beginning of a project and not updated to take into account unforeseen complexity. Here at the Guardian we adopt an Agile development methodology.

For someone relatively new to AWS, the number of different services can be overwhelming - Cloudformation, Autoscaling Groups, Load Balancers, Notification Topics, S3 buckets... and each service has its own parameters determining behaviour and which users have access to it. Getting to grips with all the infrastructure that the code you write will run on is a challenge, but worth it in the long run.</p>","elementId":"acf073a2-5023-48f0-be9a-9eee1a778916"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p><strong>Invest the time to write clean, reusable code.</strong> In the whirlwind of a product launch, there is always a temptation to let code reusability take a backseat to actually shipping a sparkling new feature out to the world, but don’t let it. Investing the extra time initially will save you and your fellow developers hours of pain when it comes to maintaining and building on your code. On theguardian.com we use <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a>, a CSS pre-processor which lets developers use many features not natively available in CSS, such as variables and functions. This allows us to package up reusable chunks of CSS into helpers called mixins. We have a host of Sass mixins that automatically include the vendor-prefixes for CSS3 features such as transitions and box shadows, leaving our pre-compiled code much more readable and maintainable. As a new developer to the project, the number of in-house mixins increased the project’s learning curve, but by the four week mark they started to become second nature and many are now staples in my personal projects too.</p>","elementId":"6348103e-d180-49c9-a237-0b173ea73ceb"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p><em>The Guardian is looking for graduate developers to start in September 2015.
