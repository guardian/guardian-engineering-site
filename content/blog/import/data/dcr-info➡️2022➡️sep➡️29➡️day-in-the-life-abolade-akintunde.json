We knew that it was going to be a great newsletter - because the content that we produce at the Guardian is second to none - but what we wanted to ensure was that our users were getting the full value and not missing out. One of the first challenges we encountered were issues with the user sign up flow and how it wasn’t very UX friendly. The fun part is getting things tested and always working with our UX researcher to make sure they have full input into the work (kudos to Georgia Elis who ensured we were always involving user research and thinking user needs). It felt amazing to work through the roadblocks and finally seeing First Edition landing in the user’s inbox.</p>","elementId":"4bfbbe11-2875-4570-8f8c-f0751b386fd1"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p><strong>What is your favourite thing about working at the Guardian?</strong></p>","elementId":"1d863ff8-2513-4d43-9dc1-302546ab154f"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>I love that they speak true to matters that are currently happening.

When I speak about mental health or myself being a minority I don’t feel excluded or segregated, instead I feel like I work for a company that really cares about that part of me.
