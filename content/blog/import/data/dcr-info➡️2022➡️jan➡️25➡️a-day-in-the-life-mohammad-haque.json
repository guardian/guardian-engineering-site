One of my favourites is the Product and Engineering ‘All Hands’ which is a fortnightly departmental meeting and an opportunity to share news, celebrate success, learn a little bit more about other parts of the business and – most importantly – meet any new starters. We are also hiring at the moment so I also have quite a few interviews I attend as well. I enjoy being part of the process and getting to meet potential new team members.</p>","elementId":"6c9e74f8-224f-40b2-8f56-aba1e79539da"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p><strong>What do you enjoy the most about working here?</strong></p>","elementId":"587ff642-425f-42a3-9e78-a1d377139da3"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>My favourite part is feeling like you can affect real change as an individual and that you’re not just another cog in the machine.

Being a religious man, and knowing how my religion has been often portrayed in the media, I have also never felt discriminated against here. We even have a prayer room in the office which I take full advantage of any time I’m in. There is a great respect and fellowship between colleagues here.
