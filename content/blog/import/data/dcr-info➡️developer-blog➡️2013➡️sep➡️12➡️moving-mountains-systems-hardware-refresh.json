last year, the Guardian digital estate was nearing end of support, and was starting to look a little long in the tooth. While the Guardian's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_operations\">web systems</a> team has always been very good at making sure things are in configuration management and are easy to build and rebuild, you can't just magic up new resource where there isn't any. In short, we were at capacity. Also, adding new physical servers and network infrastructure to satisfy new requests for resource is time consuming, and was making bringing up new products take longer than any of us liked. Many development teams turned to <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/\">AWS</a> to bridge the gap in turnaround time, although this meant additional cost.</p>","elementId":"e3bcff34-0405-4d52-9b9b-75eb02d97e07"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>The need for a hardware refresh presented an opportunity for us: we could just replace the hardware and carry on much as we did before, or we could try to build a better platform.

Some development teams are happy running the entire <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack\">stack</a> themselves, from configuring the OS to deploying the applications. At the other end of the scale, many projects use 'Platform as a Service' offerings like <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine/\">Google App Engine</a> or Amazon's <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/\">Elastic Beanstalk</a>, and don't worry about anything below the application level.
