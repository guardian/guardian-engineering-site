So we were acutely conscious of this “critical-mass” notion and it was front of mind throughout.

The point was raised about how it suddenly became a complicated chat application, when we could have just done something simple in the tooling to make it a bit easier to surface images etc, which is a fair point to raise, but in preparation for this post I found one of the early OKRs that articulates the ‘opportunity’ associated with expanding the scope beyond some simple way of being able to propose pictures.
