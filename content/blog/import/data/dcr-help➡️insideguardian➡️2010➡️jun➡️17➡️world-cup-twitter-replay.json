Our football mad product manager, Alex Liesche, had the solution: a large number of our existent match and tournament pages on the site are generated from feeds provided by ESA. Once a match is completed, they provide a full summary of teams fielded and major game events like goals, cards and corners. The Java guys then coaxed the requisite tournament data into a single summary and the stage was set.</p>","elementId":"42ef2c0a-36db-4335-b53a-5a8be43fcb2f"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>The biggest job throughout this process fell to one man. <a href=\"http://www.fr1n63.com/\">Martin Shuttleworth</a> is a fantastic Flash developer who I've worked with a number of times in the past. Once the designs were ready and the various data feeds agreed, we sat down and discussed how the interactive itself would work. On start up, the appropriate data would be loaded and assembled to model the tournament. A match browser would enable any completed game to be selected for replay. Once the game summary was loaded, the appropriate time window would be calculated and a call made to the word popularity API. With all the data in place, the main view could be built and the match replay started. Data flow would be controlled from an interactive timeline representing the match duration in the same way a video scrubber might. Replay would whizz through at sixty times real speed, so 90 minutes could be watched in 90 seconds. Users would have the freedom to pause, rewind or jump to a specific moment in time. At the heart of all this we have a series of data frames, each one describing the 20 most popular words for a specific minute in time. Each frame could be represented graphically as a series of bubbles sized according to word popularity. Transitioning from one minute to another would be a question of animating the change from one state to the next.</p>","elementId":"3ae62a1e-585e-45f7-bba4-493328c6d93b"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>At this point, I should probably mention where the real magic lies. If you've ever watched someone drawing a packed circle layout by hand, you'll know it takes some time. The circles must all be sized according to their relative values but never overlap. Our code would need to make these calculations more or less in realtime. Word popularity could vary drastically from one minute to the next, particularly if a user was jumping around the timeline at will. The solution, I knew, would involve a physics engine. <a href=\"http://www.box2d.org/\">Box2D</a> has a great pedigree, having started off as a C library for games programming. Furthermore, <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/articles/avm2overview.pdf\">AVM2</a> is reasonably fast when executing mathematical calculations. Still, keeping our balls in order was going to be a big challenge. To my mind, Martin not only solved this problem, he managed to solve it so that the animation feels right. In lesser hands, the explosions of activity surrounding each goal might have become a swollen mess. Hats off to Mr Shuttleworth.</p>","elementId":"c3bcadd0-9053-4679-9203-66f983774b8a"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>To recap: we started by figuring out how to collect aggregate stats from Twitter, produced an initial design for representing this data graphically, pulled together some supplementary feeds of match and team information and then started to build an interactive that uses a physics engine to help render animated replays of the changes in word popularity over time. What else could possibly be required? As always, the devil was in the detail. Once we started to work with the ESA feeds, we discovered that they didn't include all the information we needed. Most crucially, they provided no accurate indication of when matches were finished or how penalty shootouts unfolded. Thankfully, our ever helpful Central production and sport teams came to the rescue. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paultorpey\">Paul Torpey</a> and the sport team undertook to maintain a number of Google Docs that would fill in all the gaps in the ESA data. One should never underestimate the importance of this kind of manual intervention. With the project running to such a tight deadline, we would have been hard pressed to get things done otherwise.</p>","elementId":"ae27913c-0f40-49c1-9f16-2fed165e7dbe"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>Two final challenges emerged just as we were preparing to go live. On one hand, I delved into the <a href=\"http://www.computus.org/journal/?p=44\">depths of Flash's Date object</a> to ensure that everything would work in every possible timezone. On the other, we'd decided to allow deep linking of individual games using <a href=\"http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/\">swfaddress</a>. This isn't a standard feature of our interactive pages and we weren't due to release a new version of the main site code for at least another week. Kudos in this case goes to dev team stalwarts <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/grant-klopper\">Grant Klopper</a> and Tony McCrae who incorporated the appropriate JavaScript file through a little known back door.
