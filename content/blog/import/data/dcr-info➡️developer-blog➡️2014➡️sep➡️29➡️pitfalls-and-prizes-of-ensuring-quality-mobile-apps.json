For example, we learnt a lot about our app when I took a trip to France, and used it on Eurostar. My signal fluctuated greatly as I hurtled through different signal areas, lost connection completely while in the tunnel, then re-emerged on a completely different network at the other end.

It must be remembered however, just as with all other approaches to testing, it is in essence a risk-based approach, and cannot be considered foolproof. The whole endeavour is steered towards reducing risk when it comes to releasing the app to production, however that does mean it completely eradicates risk. For example, you may have a sample group of 5,000 users running a beta version of your app, and see a crash that affects 10 users, so 0.2% of your sample. This would – completely reasonably depending on the crash stacktrace – be discounted as an extremely low risk issue, as it is most likely due to a specific condition of the user’s device, with nothing that the app can do to compensate for it. Once extrapolated to a million users when live, however, a bug that will affect 0.2% of your users is 2,000 users.
