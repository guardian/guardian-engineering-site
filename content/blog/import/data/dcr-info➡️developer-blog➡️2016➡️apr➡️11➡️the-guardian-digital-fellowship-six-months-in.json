As someone who spends a scarily high proportion of my free time mindlessly consuming articles on my smartphone and religiously checking the news just in case anything mildly interesting has happened somewhere in the world, the Guardian was a natural choice for me.

Every morning at 9.30am, Katharine Viner, the editor in chief, hosts a meeting that anyone can attend called the Morning Conference (or MoCo as my team fondly refers to it, although I must stress this is an unofficial nickname; it’s use is a sign of our affection, rather than an attempt to trivialise what is a pretty important daily event). The first 15 minutes is usually a round-up of what went well and what didn’t from the previous days news. After that (and this is the exciting bit) the news of the day is debated. Being in a room with some of the top analytical minds in the country locking horns over the freshest current affairs is fascinating, and if you are feeling really brave you can weigh in with your own opinion, which must be said is an altogether terrifying experience. After 4 months I built up the courage to say something in MoCo, after which I turned so red I was almost indistinguishable from a ripe tomato, but it was 100% worth it. Every now and then MoCo is hosted by a special guest, and when this happens it is advisable to get down early as most of the payroll usually tries to get a seat. Since I’ve been here we have had acclaimed actor John Lithgow, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell who were all really interesting.</p>","elementId":"02a9a9ae-f281-4ca8-bab4-7a61b500de0b"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.SubheadingBlockElement","html":"<h2>The Logistics</h2>","elementId":"ecf7ef6d-0d3f-423f-877e-6bf9c09c7919"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>I’m Susie and I was a Guardian reader long before I became a Guardian employee.

This has made the transfer from student to commuter considerably less painful. It’s also great for taking advantage of evening events happening in London as meetups, museums and a host of other activities never seem too far away. The Guardian’s flexi-time policies means that you can also work around the commuter rush.

It’s very hard to resist a stroll out at lunchtime to see which street food vendors are there, especially when it’s sunny. The office is also well placed for when you just want a break from the office and to get outside. We are based on the banks of the canal so a lunchtime walk, run or bike ride away from the busy roads of central London is always possible, you just have to decide whether you want to head towards Hackney or Camden. If you’re not keen to brave the elements in winter you can head to the local gym and take advantage of the employee discount offered there. If you’d prefer a less active lunchtime, but you still want to get away from your desk, there are also lots of places to sit, watch the world go by and spend some time offline (don’t worry there’s 4G so you can instagram, tweet and snapchat the fact you’re offline...).</p>","elementId":"c1abd77e-f373-4982-a79e-555c158c5001"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.SubheadingBlockElement","html":"<h2>The Extras</h2>","elementId":"4b98e411-0742-40ca-8013-4e248faea95e"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>I’m Emma and currently work on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2015/aug/12/open-sourcing-grid-image-service\">the Grid</a> team which is part of Editorial Tools.
