A small team was spun up, led by a product manager with both an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-michel\">editorial and commercial</a> background. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alex-ware\">One of my developers</a> initially went over to be part of that team, and it was he who came up with the team’s name which will forever be etched into Guardian lore: “Giraffe” – in homage to Project Zebra of course! This team developed a <a href=\"https://github.com/guardian/membership-frontend/pull/1074\">proof-of-concept</a> and launched it in time for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a>. Over the next few months, the Giraffe team brought in an engineering manager and morphed into a “huddle” (what we call a cross-functional product development team) which included staff from design, user experience, user research, marketing, editorial and data disciplines. This huddle launched a brand new <a href=\"https://github.com/guardian/contributions-frontend/pull/54\">e-commerce website</a> which leveraged the latest <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/libraries\">Stripe</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/\">PayPal</a> payment platform software development kits, as well as a fork (<a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository\">a point-in-time code branch</a>) of the open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/guardian/snowplow\">Snowplow</a> analytics software which we called “Bolt”. It was an early success, mostly due to the huddle continually optimising not only the website, but also their ways of working. For example: only once Bolt’s data demonstrated that there was a high likelihood of achieving sustainable revenue from a new initiative (more about these later), did the team proceed to harden the underlying process and technology stack that facilitated it.</p>","elementId":"64dc2fb4-e8df-41f3-a914-f294a80026fb"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>Meanwhile, back in the Membership and Subscriptions team (née <a href=\"https://github.com/guardian/subscriptions-frontend/pull/531\">Wildebeest</a> team – for a brief period of time we copied the Giraffe team by naming our team after African savannah animals), we were frantically migrating 4 different subscriber bases of the digital pack, newspaper home delivery, newspaper voucher book and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weekly\">Guardian Weekly</a> – a weekly print news magazine for a global audience – away from a handful of third party operation houses, into what we called the “Touchpoint” platform which was used for membership.

The huddle discovered that the epic (which required far less prominence compared to our very first channel at scale: <a href=\"https://github.com/guardian/frontend/pull/13428\">the banner</a>) would yield an incredible conversion rate whenever the support message resonated in some way with the content or tone of the article above it. Its long form enabled the Giraffe huddle to define and periodically redefine “the product”: eg the importance of your support, and the impact the Guardian is making. The epic also kickstarted a flywheel effect as we realised that we could better sell our digital (app + web), newspaper and magazine subscriptions through supporter messaging rather than traditional benefit-led marketing messages. Although of course discounting still proved mightily effective, we had essentially discovered a whole new receptive audience for our marketers to engage with.

Here’s how it works: by using this technique for optimisation, we engage an evolutionary force on our messaging. We routinely collaborate with both marketing and editorial to speedily write and deploy “challenger” messages that are either relevant to the news agenda, or explain some aspect of the Guardian’s story. These are tested against regional “champion” messages (which I affectionately call the “alligators in the pond” – although maybe they should be called the “lions in the savannah”?) which contain themes that best describe why a reader in that corner of the world should support the Guardian.
