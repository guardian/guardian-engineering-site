At 10.30am we have an iOS and Android stand up for the wider team, including people from design, UX and QA teams among others. That’s followed by an iOS developer-only stand up, where we can go into the technical details of things we’re working on and help each other out. My calendar is generally fairly busy with regular team meetings such as dev time, demos, retros, and planning, but there are plenty of chances to focus on something and do some deep thinking as well.</p>","elementId":"b6510b80-8ad3-4bd6-a999-1485d46df4ff"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p><strong>What project are you working on right now?</strong></p>","elementId":"9b71469f-9fdf-47d0-b03d-f911eb7a6557"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>I’ve recently done a lot of work on the user interface of the app, making incremental changes that give it a more modern feel and bring it more into line with how stories are displayed on the website.

We also have some work coming up on improving the accessibility of the app. The Digital Accessibility Centre – a non-profit company created to create digital media that meets best practice accessibility standards – are now doing an audit of the app. Following the audit we will soon be implementing their recommendations to ensure that our app is accessible to everyone.</p>","elementId":"e06879d6-8d6b-4259-9b09-9033ecf7ba90"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p><strong>What advice would you give your younger self?</strong></p>","elementId":"1f936286-c552-4b27-92b2-ae29eaf34421"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>I used to be afraid of asking ‘silly’ questions.
