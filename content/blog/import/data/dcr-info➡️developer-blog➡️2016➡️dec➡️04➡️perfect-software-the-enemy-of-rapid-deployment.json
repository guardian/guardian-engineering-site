And we set to work improving our monitoring so that it became easier to spot issues in production, and we pared down our alerting so that the alerts we did get became meaningful. For lower traffic areas of our site, where we couldn’t rely on monitoring for feedback (because of the infrequency of events that we could use to verify the health of our products), we chose to create a bare minimum of automated critical path tests that ran post-deploy and in production. And, for risky changes, if all of the above were still not enough to make us feel confident to release to production, we used canary, or staged, releases to drip feed features to proportions of our users at a time, in order to build up confidence. As a logical progression to monitoring we started to increasingly consider the option of testing in production: using real time tracking of key user journeys in production to provide us with the confidence that we hadn’t broken key features once we’d deployed.</p>","elementId":"538d8350-568c-405e-af56-7ec64295c2da"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>Meanwhile, in our apps team, because we couldn’t implement some of the other risk-mitigating techniques, and, crucially, because we couldn’t easily ship and fix quickly, we decided to spend time and effort creating alpha and beta programmes so that we could be confident in our releases before shipping to the play/app stores.
