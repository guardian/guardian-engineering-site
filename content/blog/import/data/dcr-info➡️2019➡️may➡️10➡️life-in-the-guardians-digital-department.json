Remote working is becoming more common with a real effort made by all staff to include those working remotely, for example streaming meetings via Hangouts. There are options for working part-time too.</p>","elementId":"29d37cb1-e37b-490b-99be-f4e85ebcf9cd"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement","label":"Quick Guide","credit":"","id":"cfee56d3-053e-46e7-9d03-ec0704b3d476","elementId":"8ee05635-b83a-4311-b6b8-bbdc4a8288c9","title":"How do I join The Guardian Product & Engineering?","html":"<p><strong>Where can I find open positions?</strong></p><p>Apply for one of our open positions <a href=\"https://workforus.theguardian.com/careers/product-engineering\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>What can I expect from the interview process?</strong></p><p>We aim to be as fair and transparent as possible in our hiring process.
