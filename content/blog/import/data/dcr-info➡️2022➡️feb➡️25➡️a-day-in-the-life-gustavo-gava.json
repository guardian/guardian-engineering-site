Designing an app was a rewarding experience, but I thought it was the right time to look for a job that combined my skill set, editorial design with an organisation doing something positive in the world. The Guardian was the natural choice as it was the newspaper close to my heart and aligned with my values.</p>","elementId":"aeb8a35a-0968-4ad4-b9b8-b2547ea1970b"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>So consequently, one night, after a few exhausting hours of application submissions and a glass of wine, I noticed an advert in one of the LinkedIn newsletters. Two weeks later, I got an email, then a phone call and finally an interview. Suddenly I found myself starting my journey at the Guardian as a senior UX designer.</p>","elementId":"778e29db-b00b-49c1-93b6-a729dd656cbc"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p><strong>What does a typical day look like?</strong></p>","elementId":"19a59126-f218-45fd-8e98-916cc401ebc6"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>I wake up quite early, and one of the first things I like to do is check our chat channels to see if I missed anything from the day before or overnight. Then I have a look at my calendar to double-check if there is any change in my schedule for the day. Most days, I officially start with a standup, but on Tuesday, we have a design heartbeat meeting where we update each other on where we are in design work across teams and talk about case studies and new ideas. Throughout my time at the Product and Engineering team, I worked in different huddles, such as Editorial Tools and Journalism. Still, I stayed over three years in the Supporter Revenue team to create the best experience for our readers and encourage them to become supporters.</p>","elementId":"a75cd592-109d-45b4-835c-338ffe09c720"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>So, the rest of my day is either individual work or many one-to-one and cross-functional meetings.

I find my day-to-day work more meaningful, our efforts are for the right reasons, and I feel at home as my colleagues are progressive like-minded individuals. Also, I really love the morning conference which is our daily news meeting led by our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. It’s open to anyone in the organisation and it is an opportunity to hear what our editorial teams are planning to publish that day. I think it’s one of the best perks of working here because you feel like you’re at the very beating heart of the news. Knowing that part of my work involves making sure all our wonderful journalists are able to do their jobs is very rewarding for me; holistically as well as practically for I was previously on the team working on editorial tools. The UX experience for me isn’t just about the external reader but also about the internal user and those people are some of the more amazing, principled and hardworking individuals I have had the pleasure of working with.</p>","elementId":"dc20b0dc-d8c7-4183-b1e3-42205dc6b06f"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p><em><strong>Development of digital products is central to the Guardian.
