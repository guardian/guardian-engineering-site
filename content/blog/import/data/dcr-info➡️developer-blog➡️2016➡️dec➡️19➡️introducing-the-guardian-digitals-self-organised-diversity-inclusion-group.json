And we continued to work closely with our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre\">Education Centre</a> who do a brilliant job promoting both Guardian journalism and the way we deliver our journalism digitally. We find that there is an increasing crossover between the work that they, and we, do. We got a group of hiring managers together to map out our hiring practices and work out what different managers did well and what we could learn from one another.</p>","elementId":"6c2544ca-f500-42f0-bf15-4c63c952d4f9"},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"<p>One final lesson we’ve learned is the power of allowing this to be a part of people’s job. This effort started organically by people who cared about this topic and essentially volunteered their own time. Like any effort to affect change, sometimes improvements don’t come quickly enough - especially when people don’t really have time dedicated to it. Allowing (and encouraging) individuals the time and space to work on diversity and inclusion initiatives as part of their job, rather than as an added extra, improves the efficacy of these efforts and gives our staff the clear message in no uncertain terms that these values are endorsed and embraced by our team.</p>","elementId":"55b19069-f427-4996-8c7a-f66faecd502e"}],"attributes":{"pinned":false,"keyEvent":false,"summary":false},"blockCreatedOn":1482154494000,"blockCreatedOnDisplay":"13.34 GMT","blockLastUpdated":1482154432000,"blockLastUpdatedDisplay":"13.33 GMT","blockFirstPublished":1482154494000,"blockFirstPublishedDisplay":"13.34 GMT","blockFirstPublishedDisplayNoTimezone":"13.34","contributors":[],"primaryDateLine":"Mon
