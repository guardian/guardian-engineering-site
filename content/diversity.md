# Diversity &amp; Inclusion

We value and respect all differences in all people (seen and unseen) at the
Guardian. Here are some of the ways in which we help to promote a diverse
and inclusive culture.

## Recruitment

- ### Job advertisement and description screening

  We use an augmented writing tool which uses a combination of natural
  language processing and data mining to screen our job postings for
  unconscious bias, reveal gendered language and help our job ads to
  appeal to a more diverse range of candidates.

- ### Blind CV reviews

  We redact candidate's names and educational institutions from CVs before
  they are reviewed by members of the Engineering team to avoid
  unconscious bias in the selection process.

- ### CV screening

  Two members of the Engineering team independently review redacted CVs
  before meeting to discuss their decisions together. We encourage
  rotation of these groups to promote a broad and diverse range of
  reviewers.

## Benefits

### Flexible Working

flexible working can create a range of employment opportunities
to suit both changing operational needs and the needs of
individuals. It can also increase employment opportunities for
anyone with caring responsibilities who are unable to work full
time. We recognise the importance of flexible working as part of
its wider commitment to diversity and equality in the workplace.

### Shared parental leave

Shared parental leave is a period of leave of up to 50 weeks
that can be shared between parents after their child is born up
until the childâ€™s first birthday. It provides parents with more
choice around how they balance their caregiving responsibilities
and can help to improve diversity and inclusion in the
workplace.
