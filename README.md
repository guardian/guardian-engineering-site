# [theguardian.engineering](https://theguardian.engineering/)’s code

This website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) as a static site.

## Development

All astro commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command        | Action                                      |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm install` | Installs dependencies                       |
| `pnpm dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `pnpm build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

Publishing is done automatically upon merging to `main`.
